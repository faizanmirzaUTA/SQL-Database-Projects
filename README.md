# SQL Database Management & Data Analysis (Oracle)

This repository showcases SQL projects developed in **Oracle SQL Developer**, along with supporting **Excel models** demonstrating **functional dependencies, normalization (1NF → 3NF), and entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs)**.  

---

## Technologies Used
- SQL (Oracle SQL Developer)  
- Excel (diagrams & normalization steps)  
- Data Modeling (FDs, ERDs, Normal Forms)  

---

## Project Parts

### **Part 1 – SQL Queries & Reporting**
- Extracted and formatted customer and sales data from relational tables (`CUSTOMER_mfm`, `SALESREP_mfm`, `ORDER_mfm`, `PRODUCT_mfm`).  
- Applied **INNER JOIN, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY** for structured reports.  
- Generated insights such as sales by representative and product performance.  

---

### **Part 2 – Advanced Data Analysis**
- Analyzed customer purchase behavior, sales trends, and product demand.  
- Applied **aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN)**.  
- Developed **nested queries and conditional logic** for detailed analysis.  

---

### **Part 3 – Database Management & Design**
- Enforced **data integrity** through constraints, primary keys, and foreign keys.  
- Applied **normalization principles (1NF → 3NF)** to reduce redundancy and improve reliability.  
- Delivered well-structured, integrity-focused queries for reporting.

## Data Modeling & Normalization (Excel)
The **Excel workbook** includes:  
- **Functional Dependency Diagrams**  
- **Normalization process from 1NF → 2NF → 3NF**  
- **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**
